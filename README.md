# NightLatch
A password manager for the ESP32-8048S070 board avaliable for purchase [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004952726089.html).

NightLatch stores all data encrypted locally on a microSD card making its attack surface smaller than network or internet-connected password management solutions.
