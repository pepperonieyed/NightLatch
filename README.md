# NightLatch
A password manager for the ESP32-8048S070 board avaliable for purchase [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004952726089.html).

NightLatch stores all data encrypted locally on a microSD card making its attack surface smaller than network or internet-connected password management solutions.

## Acknowledgements
NightLatch would not be possible without the following open-source projects:
- [Arduino_GFX](https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFX)
- [LVGL](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl)
- [Various Arduino Libraries](https://github.com/arduino-libraries)

Their hard work is greatly appreciated.
